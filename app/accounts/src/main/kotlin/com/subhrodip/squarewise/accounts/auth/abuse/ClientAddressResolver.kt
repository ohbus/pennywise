/**
 * Resolves the canonical client network address for rate-limit partitioning.
 *
 * SEC-007: Replaces the previous two-octet IPv4 truncation heuristic with a
 * trusted-proxy-aware resolver that:
 * - Only consults forwarded headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`) when the
 *   immediate remote socket address matches a configured trusted proxy.
 * - Falls back to the raw socket `remoteAddr` for direct or untrusted connections,
 *   preventing header spoofing from arbitrary clients.
 * - Normalizes IPv4 addresses to /24 subnets and IPv6 addresses to /48 prefixes,
 *   providing coarse abuse partitioning without accidental collisions across unrelated
 *   address blocks.
 *
 * The returned partition string is always non-empty and safe to pass to
 * [LoginRateLimitKeyDeriver] and [RefreshRateLimitService].
 *
 * @param trustedProxies the set of trusted proxy [InetAddress] values derived from
 *   [TrustedProxyProperties]; may be empty (all connections treated as direct).
