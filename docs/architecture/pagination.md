# Pagination policy

Pagination is selected per endpoint based on growth and consistency needs.

| Endpoint shape | Strategy | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Group list, inbox, expense list, search/export | Cursor with bounded `limit` | Results grow and must remain stable while writes occur |
| Sync snapshot and change feed | Opaque cursor / revision token | Offline recovery requires resumable, gap-free ordering |
| Balances, profile, preferences, allocation preview, create/update/delete commands | No pagination | Each response is a bounded resource or a single command result |
| Invitations and settlements by ID | No pagination | Point operations addressed by an immutable identifier |

Cursor tokens are opaque, scoped to the authenticated subject and resource,
expire when the retention window requires, and return a next cursor plus a
bounded page. Page-number pagination is reserved for explicitly bounded,
non-mutating administrative views where random access is required; it is not
used for financial history or synchronization.

Every collection contract must declare its maximum page size, ordering key,
cursor semantics, authorization scope, and expired-cursor behavior before
implementation. A collection must never silently return an unbounded array.
